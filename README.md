# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
On vacation in New York City, a friend and I used Citi Bike bike-sharing to get around. Citi Bike helped us really explore the city and interact with more New Yorkers. We decided to use the data from Citi Bike to present to a potential investor so that we can start a similar business in Des Moines, Iowa.
